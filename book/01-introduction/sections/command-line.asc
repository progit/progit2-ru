=== The Command Line

There are a lot of different ways to use Git.
There are the original command line tools, and there are many graphical user interfaces of varying capabilities.
For this book, we will be using Git on the command line.
For one, the command line is the only place you can run *all* Git commands â€“ most of the GUIs only implement some subset of Git functionality for simplicity.
If you know how to run the command line version, you can probably also figure out how to run the GUI version, while the opposite is not neccesarily true.
Also, while your choice of graphical client is a matter of personal taste, _all_ users will have the command-line tools installed and available.

So we will expect you to know how to open Terminal in Mac or Command Prompt or Powershell in Windows.
If you don't know what we're talking about here, you may need to stop and research that quickly so that you can follow the rest of the examples and descriptions in this book.
